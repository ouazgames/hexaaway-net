          <h2>What is Geometry Dash Lite?</h2>
          <p>Geometry Dash Lite is the free version of the popular Geometry Dash game. It features a limited selection of levels perfect for players who want to experience the core gameplay without purchasing the full version. The lite version maintains all the exciting mechanics and challenging gameplay that made Geometry Dash famous.</p>
          
          <h2>Key Features of Geometry Dash Lite</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Free to Play:</strong> No payment required, just open and play</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Levels:</strong> A curated selection of levels for beginners and intermediate players</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Game Modes:</strong> Cube, ship, ball, UFO, wave, and more</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Mode:</strong> Place checkpoints to learn difficult sections</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Unlock icons and colors as you progress</li>
            <li><strong>Energetic Soundtrack:</strong> Electronic music synchronized with gameplay</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>How to Play Geometry Dash Lite</h2>
          <p>The controls are simple: press spacebar, click the mouse, or tap the screen to jump. Your cube moves automatically from left to right. Your job is to jump at the right moment to avoid spikes, gaps, and obstacles. Each level is synchronized with music, so timing is everything.</p>
          
          <p>When you crash, you restart from the beginning or from a checkpoint in practice mode. There's no time limit—try as many times as you need to beat the level. The more you play, the more you memorize the patterns and improve your timing.</p>
          
          <h2>Difficulty Progression</h2>
          <p>Geometry Dash Lite starts with easier levels to teach you the basics. As you progress, new mechanics appear: gravity portals, speed boosters, jump pads, and shape transformations. Each new level introduces something slightly more complex than the previous one.</p>
          
          <h2>Why Play Geometry Dash Lite?</h2>
          <p>If you're new to Geometry Dash, the lite version is the perfect starting point. It's completely free, loads instantly in your browser, and gives you a real taste of what makes the game so addictive. Many players use it to practice before trying the full version.</p>
          
          <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't spam jumps—every tap should be intentional</li>
            <li>Use headphones to hear the beat clearly</li>
            <li>Start with easier levels before attempting harder ones</li>
            <li>Use practice mode to study sections that always kill you</li>
            <li>Take breaks if you feel frustrated—your focus will improve after rest</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Geometry Dash Lite vs Full Version</h2>
          <p>The lite version includes fewer levels than the full game, but the core gameplay is identical. Both versions feature the same responsive controls, challenging mechanics, and satisfying progression. The lite version is ideal if you want to test the game or prefer a shorter experience.</p>
          
          <h2>Free to Play, No Downloads</h2>
          <p>Play Geometry Dash Lite directly in your browser on geometrydash.ie. No installation, no registration, and no hidden fees. Just open the game and start jumping. Your progress is saved locally in your browser.</p>
