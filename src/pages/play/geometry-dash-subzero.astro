          <h2 id="winter-theme-features">Winter Theme Features</h2>
          <p>SubZero stands out from other Geometry Dash games with its carefully crafted winter aesthetic. Every visual element has been designed to create a cohesive icy atmosphere that enhances the gameplay experience.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Icy Visual Design:</strong> Cool blue and white color schemes with beautiful winter aesthetics throughout</li>
            <li><strong>Frozen Levels:</strong> Levels designed with ice and snow-themed obstacles that fit the winter setting</li>

          </ul>
          
          <h2 id="gameplay-experience">Gameplay Experience</h2>
          <p>Geometry Dash SubZero maintains the core one-button control system. Press spacebar, click the mouse, or tap the screen to jump. Your character automatically moves forward, and you need to time your jumps perfectly to navigate through the icy obstacles and complete each level. The fundamental gameplay is familiar, but the new level designs provide fresh challenges.</p>
          
          <h2 id="level-design">Level Design and Atmosphere</h2>
          <p>The levels in SubZero are specifically designed with the winter theme in mind. Expect frozen platforms, icy spikes, and obstacles that fit the cool aesthetic. The difficulty progression is well-balanced, starting easy and gradually introducing more complex challenges. Each level feels like a journey through a frozen landscape.</p>
          
          <h2 id="game-modes">Game Modes and Transformations</h2>
          <p>Like other Geometry Dash games, SubZero features multiple game modes. Your character transforms into different forms—cube, ship, ball, UFO, wave, and more. Each form has unique physics and controls, adding variety to the gameplay and keeping things fresh throughout the game. Learning how each form works is essential for progression.</p>
          
          <h2 id="cube-form">The Cube Form in Winter</h2>
          <p>The cube is your default form and the most straightforward to control. In SubZero, the cube form is used extensively in the early and mid-game levels, making it essential to master for progression.</p>
          
          <h2 id="advanced-forms">Advanced Forms in SubZero</h2>
          <p>SubZero introduces challenging uses of the ship, ball, UFO, and wave forms. These forms require precise timing and control. The winter-themed levels are designed to teach you how to use each form effectively through practice and repetition.</p>
          
          <h2 id="practice-mode">Practice Mode for Learning</h2>
          <p>Struggling with a difficult section? Use practice mode to place checkpoints and practice specific parts without restarting from the beginning. This feature is crucial for learning tough sequences and improving your consistency. The winter-themed levels can be challenging, so practice mode is essential.</p>
          
          <h2 id="customization">Customization Options</h2>
          <p>As you progress through SubZero, unlock new icons, colors, and customization options. Make your character unique with winter-themed skins and visual effects that fit the icy aesthetic. The customization options in SubZero have a distinctly wintry feel.</p>
          
          <h2 id="why-play">Why Play Geometry Dash SubZero?</h2>
          <p>If you're looking for a fresh take on Geometry Dash with a unique visual theme, SubZero delivers. The winter aesthetic is beautifully executed, the music is catchy, and the levels offer a good challenge for both newcomers and experienced players. It's a great addition to the Geometry Dash franchise that feels distinct from the original.</p>

          <h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty and Progression</h2>
          <p>SubZero offers a good difficulty curve suitable for both new and experienced players. Early levels teach you the basics with simple jumps and straightforward obstacles.
