          <h2 id="what-are-geometry-dash-games">What Are Geometry Dash Games?</h2>
          <p>Geometry Dash games are a series of rhythm-based platformers created by Robert Topala (RobTop Games). The core concept involves controlling a geometric shape (usually a cube) that moves automatically through a level. The player must tap the screen or press a key to make the shape jump, fly, or flip, avoiding obstacles that are perfectly synchronized with the background music. This unique blend of platforming and music creates an incredibly addictive and challenging experience.</p>

          <p>The franchise has grown significantly since the original release in 2013, spawning several official spin-offs that introduce new levels, music, and visual themes. While the difficulty is high, the simple one-touch controls make the games easy to pick up, though mastering them requires precision, patience, and pattern recognition.</p>
