          <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>

Each form has unique physics and controls, keeping the gameplay varied and interesting throughout your journey.</p>
          
          <h2>Practice Mode</h2>
          <p>Stuck on a challenging section? Use practice mode to place checkpoints and practice specific parts of a level without restarting from the beginning. This feature helps you learn difficult sequences and improve your consistency.</p>
          
          <h2>Customization and Unlockables</h2>
          <p>Progress through Breeze to unlock new icons, colors, and customization options. Personalize your character with colorful skins and visual effects that match the vibrant aesthetic of the game.</p>
          
          <h2>Why Play Geometry Dash Breeze?</h2>
